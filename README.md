🚧 Status: Archived (Architecture Spike)

Incident Ops was an exploratory backend architecture project focused on building a generalized operational event tracking engine.

The core concepts explored here (event modeling, audit logging, extensible workflows) are being folded into Defect Tracker, which is now the active project.

This repository remains as:

A reference for architectural thinking

A system design exploration

A foundation for future expansion

Active development has shifted to:
